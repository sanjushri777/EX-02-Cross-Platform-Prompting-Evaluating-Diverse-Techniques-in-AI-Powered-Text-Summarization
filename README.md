## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Algorithm
Define the Use Case: Select a specific task for evaluation across platforms (e.g., summarizing a document, answering a technical questiogenerating a creative story / Code). Ensure the use case is applicable to all platforms and will allow for comparison across response quaaccuracy, and depth. Create a Set of Prompts: Prepare a uniform set of prompts that align with the chosen use case. Each prompt shoulclear and precise, ensuring that all platforms are evaluated using the same input. Consider multiple prompts to capture the versatility oplatform in handling different aspects of the use case. Run the Experiment on Each AI Platform: Input the prompts into each AI tool (ChClaude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) and gather the responses. Ensure the same conditions are applied for each platform, such aformat, time to respond, and prompt delivery. Record response times, ease of interaction with the platform, and any technical issuesencountered. Evaluate Response Quality: Assess each platform’s responses using the following criteria: Accuracy,Clarity,Depth,RelevanceCompare Performance: Compare the collected data to identify differences in performance across platforms. Identify any platform-speciadvantages, such as faster response times, more accurate answers, or more intuitive interfaces. Deliverables: A comparison table outliniperformance of each platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta) based on accuracy, clarity, depth, and relevance ofresponses. A final report summarizing the findings of the experiment, including recommendations on the most suitable AI platform for use cases based on performance and user

### 6.Experiential Perspective Prompt
Prompt: "What is the best way to improve focus while studying?"

ChatGPT: Minimize distractions by finding a quiet space, use the Pomodoro Technique, break tasks into smaller chunks, take short breaks, stay hydrated, and get enough sleep.

Claude: Focus can be improved by organizing your study space, setting clear goals, and using active recall and spaced repetition. Minimizing distractions and taking regular breaks will help.

Bard: The best way to improve focus is to create a distraction-free study environment, set specific goals, and use techniques like Pomodoro. Mindfulness techniques and regular breaks can also be helpful.

Cohere Command: Limit distractions, use the Pomodoro Technique, and take regular breaks. Organize study materials and set clear goals to stay focused.
